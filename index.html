                        <h3>Bio</h3>
                            <p> The first objective of life i wanted to achieve was to join the
                                Bundespolizei(BPOL). When I was 21 I graduated top of the class with MFA Munich Flight
                                Academy GmbH. I later became a Helicopter Technician for the BPOL Aviation Group.
                                While I was there I decided to make a ground-based device that destoys small projectiles,
                                this Active Defense System (ADS) prototype caught the attention of the GSG-9. The
                                United States had been under attack by a mysterious terrorist organization, since the
                                invention of the ADS the U.S. government saw use in me. They ressurected an old op group
                                by the name of Rainbow Six, and I was apart of it. Our last mission was Barlett
                                University, after that I was sent home to the GSG-9 waiting for redeployment.</p>

                        <h3>Active Defense System Prototype</h3>
                            <p>This prototype is the more portable baby brother of the AMAP-ADS, this ADS is the
                                first of its kind to be the size of a small box. Like the older brother, this ADS
                                destroys anything bigger than a bullet.
